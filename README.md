# Netflix Recommendation System

The Movielens project is part of the final course in the **HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science**.
And this report is part of the Movielens project. The challenge is to create and evaluate prediction models that will predict the ratings some Netflix users would assign to some movies.  
The Netflix data is not publicly available so I used the dataset MovieLens proposed by HarvardX and provided by [*GroupLens research Lab*](https://grouplens.org/).
The dataset consists of 69878 users who rated 10677 movies grouped in 797 combinations of 20
distinct genres
In this report, I start with a shallow analysis of the dataset then, I describe the different models evaluated to develop a recommendation system to be applied to Netflix movies ratings.
